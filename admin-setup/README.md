### Wordpress overview

![Wordpress overview](./rect18.jpg "Wordpress overview")

Wordpress is software that runs on a host server. Although it is possible to get free hosting, it is usually with a paid service that has it's own software. The host software can create a blank wordpress site, upload (or download) files and start the wordpress system so that it can then be accessed by a web browser

Wordpress can be accessed either as a user or as an administrator

`www.site-name` accesses the user view

`www.site-name/admin` accesses the admin view, and requires login. The admin view has lots of different tabs and menus and can be used to edit the site, change theme or add Wordpress packages. Once the site has been set up, this is the main way to access and change the site
